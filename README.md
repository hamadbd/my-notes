# Short pragraph [What I've learned:)  ]
I believe that this article is **very** impoirtant and every developer should re-read it and take a look at it every once in a while and think about it ...

It shows what most of the coders out there faces as problems and how to deal with it, as one of my mentors said ***"it's all mindset"***, as long as the coder knows what is he using, building, impleminting or trying to create and has the full confidence and a beleive in himself ... he can do it exactly as same as he imagine if its not even better !

If you'd let me suggest something that is related to the article I'd defenitly want you to just go right away right now and listen to ***YWIYC by Kevin Trudue*** this man has nothing to do with coding but has everything to do with building your own mindset and how to make you confidnt and he basically teaches you how to ***"Control your thoughts"*** , ever had an experience where you kept thinking of somehing and suddenly out of nowhere it happens ? well .... its because your mind is like a magnet and your thoughts is what controls it . :)
